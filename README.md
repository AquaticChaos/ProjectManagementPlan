This second-draft PMP document goes over the scope of the small business Worth Your Words, which aims to teach children how to express themselves through audio-based arts, including music and poems.
It's important to note that this document was a collaborative effort with five other team members. Additionally, this repository will be updated with the final draft when it is finished.
